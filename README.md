## Finding the Highest K-Core Subgraph in a Protein Protein Interaction Network 
Interaction networks are composed of undirected edges that form graphs. Input interaction networks on which the program will be tested don't contain self-edges. The k-core of a graph is a subgraph in which all the nodes have at least k degrees. Thus, each node in a k-core has at least k immediate neighbors.
O (n^3) algorithm is used to find the number of proteins for each value of k such that k is the highest k-core they belong to.
